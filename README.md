# Brain refresh
The classic flip the card game and remember where all the matching cards are.

When you click a card and you have exposed a matching card, the pair will stay visible. If not it will flip back again. The scoring game tracks the number of clicks.  You start off with blank cards. At any point, you can restart the game and it will refresh the whole grid. At the end of the game you will be presented with a score.
